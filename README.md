This project was made with Bootstrap and React. The objective was to create an application that worked like the GitHub markdown, an input for the user to write, and an output
for the user to see the formatted text. Programming the entire markdown language on my own was maybe off my limits, so I used the marked library, which does exactly this,
and It's really easy to use, but it was hard at first because I didn't find the library's documentation very clear.
